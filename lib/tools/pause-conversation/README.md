# Pause Conversation Tool

The Pause Conversation tool automatically pauses conversations when specific conditions are met, transferring control to human agents.

## Features

- **Automatic Detection**: Monitors every user message for pause conditions
- **Configurable Conditions**: Define custom conditions that trigger conversation pausing
- **Immediate Action**: Pauses conversations instantly when conditions are met
- **Human Handoff**: Seamlessly transfers control to human agents

## Configuration

### Pause Condition Prompt

Define the specific conditions, phrases, or situations that should trigger the conversation to be paused. Be as specific as possible for better accuracy.

Examples:

- "When the user asks to speak to a human, wants to escalate to a manager, or says goodbye and wants to end the conversation"
- "If the user expresses frustration, asks for a refund, or mentions legal action"
- "When the user requests to cancel their subscription or asks to speak to billing"

### Pause Message

The message displayed to users when the conversation is paused. Keep it professional and informative.

Example: "This conversation has been paused. A human will take over shortly."

## How It Works

1. **Continuous Monitoring**: The tool checks every user message against your defined pause conditions
2. **Pattern Detection**: Uses keyword matching and semantic analysis to identify when conditions are met
3. **Immediate Pause**: When a match is found, the conversation is immediately paused by setting `isPaused: true`
4. **No Further Responses**: The bot stops responding until a human agent takes over

## Functions

### checkPauseCondition

- **Purpose**: Checks if a user message matches the configured pause conditions
- **Returns**: `{detected: boolean}` indicating whether the condition was met

### pauseConversation

- **Purpose**: Pauses the current conversation and prevents further bot responses
- **Action**: Updates the conversation record to set `isPaused: true`
- **Metadata**: Stores pause reason and timestamp for tracking

## Use Cases

- **Customer Escalation**: When customers ask to speak to a manager or human agent
- **Complex Issues**: For problems that require human expertise
- **Complaint Handling**: When customers express dissatisfaction that needs personal attention
- **Sales Handoff**: When qualified leads need to speak with sales representatives
- **Technical Support**: For complex technical issues beyond the bot's capability

## Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**: Create detailed pause conditions that clearly define when to escalate
2. **Test Thoroughly**: Test your conditions with various user inputs to ensure accuracy
3. **Professional Message**: Use a friendly, professional pause message
4. **Monitor Performance**: Regularly review pause triggers to optimize accuracy
5. **Train Your Team**: Ensure human agents know how to handle paused conversations
